WARNING: Based on Minecraft 1.8.1.  There MAY be incompatibilities.

This mod adds a number of classes and static methods to Minecraft to more aptly support the addition of Player Classes to the game, based on the specification put together by myself and my friends.

One can only use a class' weapons if one belongs to that class, and one belong to a class by wearing that class' armor and no other class' armor.

Requires ModLoader.
