# Obsolete #

I still plan to finish this project, and update it to Forge or something if possible, but don't hold your breath.

WARNING: Based on Minecraft BETA 1.8.1.  There ARE DEFINITELY incompatibilities with whatever you're running.

This mod adds a number of classes and static methods to Minecraft to more aptly support the addition of Player Classes to the game, based on the specification put together by myself and my friends.

One can only use a class' weapons if one belongs to that class, and one belong to a class by wearing that class' armor and no other class' armor.

Requires ModLoader.
